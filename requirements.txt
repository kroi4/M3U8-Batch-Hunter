# New dependencies for efficient m3u8 capture
# Install Playwright (recommended for best performance):
#   pip install playwright
#   playwright install chromium
# 
# Playwright is OPTIONAL but highly recommended for:
# - Much lower memory usage (~100-200MB vs 500MB+ with selenium-wire)
# - Faster capture (direct CDP access, no MITM proxy)
# - Better reliability
playwright>=1.40.0
